<div id="an-interesting-problem-in-omics-research"
class="section level2">
<h2>An interesting problem in Omics research</h2>
<p>I’ve noticed something when I work on big omics projects and I know
that I’m not the first. Typically there are two teams of people on any
given project, or more if it’s a multi-omics project. The
bioinformaticists that are performing the statistical analysis,
generating output results tables and figure creation (so many figures).
As well as the biologists, who may have generated the biological samples
that were processed, and will typically handle the downstream
interpretation of the omics results and place them in a biological
context. Often, but not always, there is a discrepancy between the
background and training of these groups where the bioinformaticists tend
to come from computer science, statistics or applied math fields. Of
course many of them have coursework and training in biology, this isn’t
an attack on bioinformaticists or the good work that they do, and it’s
becoming more common that they have explicit training in biology or even
a degree in biostatics or bioinformatics as these programs proliferate
in academics. But few of them have much experience doing wet bench
science like their collaborators. Also, many of them work on many
projects within many biological models and contexts so they don’t always
get the chance to dive deep into a single area of biology.</p>
<p>The opposite is normally true of the biologists on the project. Most
of us are generalists in bench science with a single or a small handful
of specialty bench skills, and a deep understanding of a typically very
narrow field of biology. Few of us have any programming skills to speak
of, nor training in how to understand the results of big data projects.
Again, this isn’t meant to be an attack on biologists, just stating the
reality of the differences in viewpoint and experience between the two
groups of people.</p>
<p>This discrepancy in background leads to a second discrepancy. Where
some of the people have deep intimate access to the data, and some of
the people have a deep intimate knowledge of the biology underlying the
data, and those typically are not the same people. This is the very
nature of team based projects, but still, a gap in knowledge between
groups can lead to a gap in communication between groups. This can have
outsized impacts on the outcome of the project.</p>
<p>To put it another way, in large-scale Omics projects, a persistent
challenge lies in bridging the communication gap between
bioinformaticists who analyze the data and biologists who interpret it.
While statistical outputs and processed data files contain a wealth of
insight, they often lack the intuitive structure or clarity needed for
effective biological interpretation. As a result, important findings may
be overlooked or misinterpreted, underscoring the need for more
accessible and integrative reporting strategies. I don’t think that this
is an easy problem either or caused by a lack of effort. All of the
people involved are highly intelligent and highly trained. I think this
is just a function of the results being large and complex; and everybody
has limited time and attention to give to it. Omics results are a
firehose, and the person on the receiving end of it is normally only
equipped with a bucket to catch as much water as they can.</p>
</div>
<div id="its-about-the-exploration-not-just-the-destination"
class="section level2">
<h2>It’s about the exploration, not just the destination</h2>
<p>Some people, however, do have skills and expertise in both worlds. I
sit at this nexus, with training and experience in bench science and
bioinformatics. My degrees are in Biology and Neuroscience and I have
over a decade of experience at the bench and the computer terminal
(mainly RNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq). Those of us with these dual skills sets
are in a relatively unique position where we can act as a liaison
between the teams. We can discuss the minutiae of software choices and
sharing analysis scripts with the one team, or the particulars of
reagent selection and sharing bench protocols with the other team.</p>
<p>I’m proposing a pretty simple solution here for a hard problem, which
is a report structure for Omics results that really facilitates the
ability of biologists to explore the dataset in an interactive way. The
report includes the core results figures and tables that typically are
provided to collaborators, but in a single interactive web portal that
acts as a clearinghouse for the results of the analysis. It’s the same
results, but formatted in a way that really draws in the biologist for a
more independent search of the dataset.</p>
<p>To that end I’ve created the below report on an analysis of RNA-Seq
data that I performed at home as an example of the kind of reporting
strategy that I think could facilitate this kind of exploration. I want
to crack open the black box of omics methodologies for biologists so
that you can see what is happening behind the scenes when you send
samples off to the core for sequencing, or when you send an email to the
bioinformaticists to ask for expression plots of a list of genes of
interest. Now, they can just… look it up themselves. I believe this
approach increases transparency and trust among collaborators, while
increasing the biologists ability to engage with the data on a deeper
level than is typically possible. Also, given the didactic focus of the
forum here, I can afford to be more casual than in a traditional
publication. So forgive me the informal tone of a lot of this page. If
you’re a biologist, hopefully you come out of this exercise with a
better appreciation for the work that the programmers do and a better
understanding of how they produce their datasets and results files.
There is a common misunderstanding in biology that “the computer does
all the work”. Don’t be that person. This is a toy example with a small
sample size and it still took me weeks of work. Hopefully this report
highlights just how much effort goes into these kinds of analyses and
the format presents a more intuitive way to understand those
results.</p>
<p>If you are not a biologist, I think there is a relatively
straightforward track that you can take to help bridge this gap that
I’ve highlighted. I’m generally in favor of transparency in science, but
I think the more you can facilitate your biologist collaborators to
engage with the data and results that you’ve created the better. The
standard output of results, like excel files and static figures showing
top hits or general trends are great, I’m not saying you should stop
providing a zip file of results. But I’ve seen many biologists excitedly
receive their data from the core, only to be stuck in fear asking the
question, “How am I supposed to make any conclusions from a 20,000 row
excel file?”. Spending the time to make an engaging and visually
appealing clearinghouse of results will also help them explore the data
in a way that an excel file will just never provide, hopefully they even
find it fun! Not to mention the polish and professional flair this kind
of effort can lend to your output. Maybe this project can provide a
better framework for reporting results to collaborators, I have a
standalone html file (here) that could be provided to a biologist as an
entry point to understanding the results, and just bundle it alongside
the standard results files that you normally provide. That also provides
privacy for unpublished data as nothing is hosted online, people can
just download the html file locally and open it in the browser on their
computer. If you decide to make the portal public later as part of the
publication process, you’ve now just made a fancy web portal for anyone
to explore your data with.</p>
<p>Maybe, you’re new to RNA-Seq analysis and you’ve come across this
post as you’re doing your first analysis. If that’s the case, I hope I
can convince you early in your journey to develop good communication
skills. As a data scientist, the results files and reports that you
produce is your work product and the better you are at presenting them
the more your collaborators will be able to mine from them. Omics
datasets are a rich resource, but often they are not fully mined for
data purely because of this gap in communication or limited time and
resources. That’s a shame in my mind, because the amount of effort that
goes into producing any one of these datasets can be enormous and there
are over half of a million RNA-Seq datasets publicly available on NCBI
resources (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz022">Zeimann,
et al. 2019</a>). The potential of this as a supply of data is immense
and it grows every single day. Many groups always do a good job of all
of this, but I think as a field we can do better on both sides. And
everyone benefits from it.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-of-dataset" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary of dataset</h2>
<p>This webpage reports the differential expression results of my
re-analysis for this really nice RNA-Seq dataset from the neurons of
patients with epilepsy
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-022-01453-1">Pai et al.,
2022</a>). The original publication is mostly concerned with
transcriptional alterations in glial cells but I’m electing to reanalyze
their neuronal samples for a few reasons. First, to highlight the
usefulness of previously published data. Second, so that I am not just
retreading the same story over again. Third, and most selfishly, my
experience lies mainly with neuronal datasets so I’m most familiar with
this output. No offense to glia, they are great, but I’m really mostly
focused on the reporting of results here!</p>
<p>The dataset consists of bulk RNA-Seq reads from three temporal lobe
control post-mortem samples (TL), and three temporal lobe with epilepsy
patient samples (TLE). In the original paper, four populations of cells
were isolated from the samples via Fluorescence Activated Nuclei Sorting
(FANS), one of those populations was the neurons and those are the
samples that I’m working with here.</p>
</div>
<div id="differential-expression-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Differential expression analysis</h2>
<p>Briefly, I started this project by downloading the fastq files for
each sample from NCBI’s, Gene Expression Omnibus
(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140393">GEO
accession: GSE140393</a>), then aligned the reads to the reference
genome and produced a set of counts files which contain the number of
reads counted for each genetic feature in the reference annotation
(ensemble: <a href="https://ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index">GRCh38
release 113</a>). Those counts files are the input files for this
differential expression analysis. Which continues with loading all of
the proper software and data files into R for processing with
DESeq2.</p>
<p>All of the scripts for my full analysis pipeline, including
downloading and preprocessing of the data before the differential
expression analysis, are on my GitHub repository for this project here:
<a href="https://github.com/rpevey/rnaQuest">RNA Quest at GitHub</a>. If
you’re not a programmer and you’ve ever been curious about the steps
that go into the differential expression analysis, then click on the
buttons labelled ‘Click to expand code’ and it will reveal the code that
goes into each step. Just remember that this script is only the very
last stage of the analysis. I’ve also included extensive comments in the
code so hopefully you can understand something of it even if you have no
programming experience. Note, the control is the reference group, that’s
hopefully obvious but I want to be explicit about it. All statistical
analysis results are epileptic neurons referenced in comparison to the
neurons of control patients.</p>

<p>Alright, the meat of the report, the results. Keep in mind that there
is a fair amount of exploratory analysis and quality control that goes
into the analysis at this stage to ensure that the data is processed
properly (e.g. normalization, regularization). Those steps were
performed here but are presented further down the page so that we can
jump right to the exciting part: the results.</p>
<p>There are 1576 significant differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt;
0.05) when comparing <strong>Epilepsy</strong> to
<strong>Control</strong> as reference. 758 are up-regulated, 818 are
down-regulated. The results of the DE analysis are summarized in the

<p>I’ve made this interactive gene expression dashboard below to help
you explore the dataset. Mouse over the genes on the volcano plot to
explore the highlighted significant genes. If you want to see the
expression profile for that specific gene then enter it, or your
favorite gene, into the gene expression plot on the right. If the gene
is statistically significant, than an FDR value and bracket indicating
significance are automatically populated. If not then the words “No DE
result” will appear instead. If you want to restrict the gene expression
plot to only display significant genes than toggle the checkbox beneath
the plot. You can see the data used to create the plot with the table
beneath it or download it by clicking the download graph data button to
capture it as a csv.</p>
<p>I have the gene expression plot hosted by a
<a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> server then piped into this
page through an iframe. So if the plot isn’t loading correctly it has
probably just gone inactive and you can find it here

<h3>Heatmap</h3>
<p>Heatmaps provide a visual representation of gene expression across
multiple samples, using color gradients to indicate expression levels.
Clustering patterns can reveal relationships between genes and
conditions, helping to identify co-regulated genes and distinct
expression profiles. The most down-regulated genes in epilepsy patient
samples all cluster in the top half of this heatmap together, these
genes correspond to the left side of the volcano plot above. Conversely,
the most up-regulated genes in the neurons of epilepsy patients cluster
to the bottom of the heatmap and show up on the right side of the
volcano plot.</p>

<strong>Table 1:</strong> These are the results of the differential
expression analysis when comparing, <strong>Epilepsy</strong> and
<strong>Control</strong> (ref.) neurons. The columns are ordered by
log2FoldChange with up-regulated genes at the top and down-regulated
genes at the bottom. Numeric values listed to 3 significant digits. An
FDR is not calculated for non-significant results. You can search for a
gene of interest by Ensembl ID or gene name using the search box at the
top.

<h3>Gene expression plots</h3>
<p>These are the exact same type of plot as the right side of the
dashboard above, except these are static instead of interactive. Gene
expression plots visualize how a gene’s expression varies across
conditions or samples, helping identify trends, variability, and
potential differential expression. Higher expression levels indicate
greater transcript abundance, while statistical comparisons (e.g.,
boxplots, dot plots) help assess significance between groups.</p>
<p>Let’s take a moment to discuss interpretting these figures. It’s
important to interpret these boxplots carefully, especially with the
small sample size here. The boxplot includes an in-built outlier test
where any point that is more than 1.5x the interquartile range (IQR, the
top and bottom of the box) above or below the median value will be
plotted as an individual datapoint outside of the range of the
“whiskers”. Generally, it would be preferrable to have a larger sample
size than 3 for each group, but sometimes you have to work with what
samples you have access to and this post is for educational purposes
remember.</p>

<p>Most down-regulated gene: <em>ARL6IP1</em>. This gene has known
functions in ER and Mitochondrial organelle homeostasis
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06090-9">Foronda et. al.,
2023</a>), and specifically in neurons it is a modulator of glutamate
transport (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18684713/">Akiduki,
2008</a>). As the most down-regulated gene in the dataset is such an
important gene for excitatory neuron function, it’s safe to say that
these neurons are not doing great.</p>
<p>Gene of interest down-regulated: <em>CALB2</em>. The <em>CALB2</em>
gene (Calbindin 2), encoding the calcium-binding protein Calretinin,
plays critical roles in neuronal excitability
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2009.05.007">Camp and
Wijesinghe, 2009</a>). Abundant in hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebral
cortex, with modified expression linked to temporal lobe epilepsy
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bht254">Dixit et. al.,
2015</a>).</p>
<p>Gene of interest up-regulated: <em>LGR6</em>. Is a Wnt-signaling
associated stem cell marker with links to cancer
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3957">Huang et. al., 2017</a>).
Generally it is not associated with expression in neurons and has very
low expression in our control neurons, but sees a huge increase in
epilepsy patient neurons in this dataset.</p>
<p>Most up-regulated gene: <em>MIR376C</em>. Is a microRNA involved in
post-transcriptional gene regulation normally associated with roles in
development
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.111.203489">Fu et.
al., 2013</a>) and homeostasis through interacting with SOX6-mediated
Wnt signalling (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S278538">Cao et.
al., 2021</a>). So, we’re already seeing Wnt signalling showing up as a
potential dysregulated pathway.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Congrats programmers, you can now hand your report off to
collaborators! I’m not going to do a full in-depth review of the results
here. The point of this post is to highlight how this interactive report
format can facilitate a deeper more intuitive exploration of the dataset
than scrolling static excel files. Having said that! We can see some
trends that jump right out at us. SNORA genes, are small non-coding
nucleolar RNAs that are generally associated with RNA regulation
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-022-01056-8">Huang et. al.,
2022</a>) and cellular stress response
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.06.019">Cheng et. al.,
2024</a>). Indicating a big increase in transcriptomic dysregulation and
cellular stress in neurons. Our Wnt signaling associated genes are a
pretty interesting hit. A cursory submission of the results into
<a href="https://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/">GOrilla</a> (results
not presented here) reveal similarities to the enrichment analysis
results in the original paper. Up-regulated results: Semaphorin-Plexin
signaling pathway, gene expression regulation, lipid metabolism
pathways. My analysis seems to show a bigger inclusion of RNA metabolism
than their analysis did. Down-regulated results: Protein transport,
cellular secretion, GABAergic synaptic transmission, axon formation.
What is clear, is that there are a lot of results to dig through here.
Happy hunting!</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>I am performing a reanalysis of previously published data
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-022-01453-1">Pai et al.,
2022</a>). Their study, briefly, collected temporal lobe tissue from
patients with medically refractory epilepsy and control donors,
preparing samples for immunofluorescence, single-cell dissociation, or
Fluorescence-Activated Nuclei Sorting (FANS). Using an enhanced FANS
protocol, they isolated nuclei from NEUN+, OLIG2+, and PAX6+ populations
and preserved RNA from sorted nuclei for downstream analysis. Total
nuclear RNA was extracted, depleted of rRNA, and used to generate
libraries for paired-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (50 bp
pair-end sequencing, 38–50 million paired-end reads/sample). They
uploaded their data as fastq files to NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO accession:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140393">GSE140393</a>),
which is were I accessed the data on 3rd, March 2025. Sequencing reads
were aligned to the human genome (ensemble:
<a href="https://ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index">GRCh38 release
113</a>) using STAR with default settings, and quantified gene-level
expression using STAR’s ‘–quantMode GeneCounts’ option. Sorted Bam files
were produced with Samtools.</p>

ported into this report file. The following code is not executed, but is
presented for transparency and reproducibility. Again, this is only the
script that I used for the differential expression analysis. If you want
all of the scripts for the full analysis including the downloading and
preprocessing of the data before the differential expression, you can
find it on my github repository for this project here:

<h3>Exploratory data analysis</h3>
<p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of visually and
statistically examining data to identify patterns, trends, and potential
issues before formal analysis. It helps ensure data quality, detect
outliers, and guide analytical decisions. If you aren’t doing the
analyses yourself, you might normally not even be presented these
figures. But they’re important sanity checks to ensure data quality.
These steps were performed before the results presented above, but I’m
presenting them here for the sake of completeness.</p>
<div id="all-samples-total-gene-counts" class="section level4">
<h4>All samples total gene counts</h4>
<p>Gene counts across all samples are shown both before and after
normalization. The first plot illustrates that raw counts are already
within a comparable range across samples. Normalization further refines
the data, ensuring consistency for downstream analysis, as seen in the
second plot.</p>

<h4>Plot dispersion estimates</h4>
<p>A diagnostic plot of how well the data fits the model created by
DESeq2 for differential expression testing. Good fit of the data to the

samples, have been filtered out for computational efficiency.</p>

<div id="dimensional-reduction-analyses" class="section level4">
<h4>Dimensional reduction analyses</h4>
<p>In a way, a lot of omics analysis in really a game of dimensional
reduction. You start off with a huge dataset where you have gene
expression data for roughly 20,000 genes, each of them it’s own
dimension. But some of the analysis techniques, such as clustering, and
especially visualizations must be done on a lower number of dimensions,
a small handful or maybe even just two.</p>
<p>In comes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional
Scaling (MDS) plots, they serve similar functions to each other and are
interpretted in roughly the same way for our purposes here. PCA and MDS
are dimensionality reduction techniques used in RNA-Seq analysis to
visualize patterns of similarity or difference between samples. They
transform high-dimensional gene expression data into a smaller number of
dimensions, typically two. Thereby making it easier to detect clustering
by condition, batch effects, or outliers. These plots provide an
intuitive overview of global transcriptional variation across the
dataset.</p>
<p>They differ in how they reduce dimensions. Critically, MDS is plotted
in a way such that distances between samples are preserved as much as
possible in the projection to lower dimensions. This is similar to the
difference between T-SNE plots and UMAP plots, where the distance
between clusters is more meaningful in UMAPs while it lacks
interpretability in T-SNE plots. However, since MDS is based on
preserving pair-wise distance you don’t natively get a measure of how
much ‘information’ each dimension carries. That’s in contrast to the
measure of variance explained by each dimension that you get out of PCA
plots. In that way they both have benefits and are a good compliment to
each other.</p>
